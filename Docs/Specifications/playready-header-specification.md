### 3.2. Syntax Requirements

#### 3.2.1. Canonicalized
The XML must be canonicalized.

#### 3.2.2. All Node and Attributes names are case-sensitive

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>• Supported</td>
        <td>&lt;KID VALUE="PV1LM/VEVk+kEOB8qqcWDg=="&gt;&lt;/KID&gt;</td>
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none">• Not supported</td>

2007/03/PlayReadyHeader"&gt;</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### 3.2.5.	Alphabetical order

All attributes must be in alphabetical order including those in nodes inside the CUSTOMATTRIBUTES node.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>• Supported</td>
        <td>&lt;KID ALGID="AESCBC" VALUE="PV1LM/VEVk+kEOB8qqcWDg=="&gt;&lt;/KID&gt;<br/>&lt;CUSTOMATTRIBUTES&gt;&lt;MyNode BarAttribute="Bar" FooAttribute="Foo"&gt;&lt;/MyNode&gt;&lt;/CUSTOMATTRIBUTES&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
</table>

### 3.3. v4.3.0.0

PlayReady Header v4.3.0.0 was introduced with PlayReady version 4.0 in September 2017 to support AESCBC keys in a header. This support allows encryption of content in CBC mode, including the Common Encryption modes CBC1 and CBCS. and also increases the interoperability of PlayReady Clients with other DRM systems, as well as existing content.

#### 3.3.1. Differences with other versions

Starting with version 4.0, PlayReady SDKs and are able to process the PlayReady Header versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. PlayReady SDKs prior to version 4.0 will return an "unsupported version" error when provided with v4.3 headers.

The PlayReady Header format v.4.3.0.0 has the following changes compared to v4.2.0.0:

  *  The **WRMHEADER** element’s version attribute is set to the string “4.3.0.0”.
  *  The **ALGID** element located inside the KID element can now have the value "AESCBC", in addition to "AESCTR", provided that:
     *  The **ALGID** element located inside the **KID** element may be missing, in a license acquisition request. We recommend that the **ALGID** element has a valid value in the header included in the content.
     *  When the **ALGID** elements are present, and there is more than one **KID** element in the **KIDS** element, all the **ALGID** values must be the same.
     *  When the **ALGID** element is set to “AESCBC”, the **CHECKSUM** attribute must not be included.

#### 3.3.2. Examples

The following is an example of a PlayReady Header 4.3.0.0 with AESCBC keys:

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.3.0.0">
  <DATA>
    <PROTECTINFO>
      <KIDS>
        <KID ALGID="AESCBC" VALUE="PV1LM/VEVk+kEOB8qqcWDg=="></KID>
        <KID ALGID="AESCBC" VALUE="tuhDoKUN7EyxDPtMRNmhyA=="></KID>
      </KIDS>
    </PROTECTINFO>
    <LA_URL>http://rm.contoso.com/rightsmanager.asmx</LA_URL>
    <DS_ID>AH+03juKbUGbHl1V/QIwRA==</DS_ID>
  </DATA>
</WRMHEADER>
```

The following is an example of a PlayReady Header 4.3.0.0 with a missing ALGID:

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.3.0.0">
  <DATA>
    <PROTECTINFO>
      <KIDS>
        <KID VALUE="PV1LM/VEVk+kEOB8qqcWDg=="></KID>
      </KIDS>
    </PROTECTINFO>
    <LA_URL>http://rm.contoso.com/rightsmanager.asmx</LA_URL>
    <DS_ID>AH+03juKbUGbHl1V/QIwRA==</DS_ID>
    <DECRYPTORSETUP>ONDEMAND</DECRYPTORSETUP>
  </DATA>
</WRMHEADER>
```

#### 3.3.3.	Format

The PlayReady Header v4.3.0.0 has the following syntax.

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.3.0.0">
  <DATA>
      <PROTECTINFO>
        <KIDS>
          <KID ALGID="value" CHECKSUM=“base64-encoded value" VALUE="base64-encoded guid"></KID>
          <KID ALGID="value" CHECKSUM=“base64-encoded value" VALUE="base64-encoded guid"></KID>
          <KID ALGID="value" CHECKSUM=“base64-encoded value" VALUE="base64-encoded guid"></KID>
        </KIDS>
      </PROTECTINFO>
      <LA_URL> URL for license acquisition </LA_URL>
      <LUI_URL>
        URL for Non-silent license acquisition web page
      </LUI_URL>
    <DS_ID> base64-encoded guid </DS_ID>
    <CUSTOMATTRIBUTES xmlns="">

        </mm:Publisher>
    </CUSTOMATTRIBUTES>
    <DECRYPTORSETUP>ONDEMAND</DECRYPTORSETUP>
  </DATA>
</WRMHEADER>
```

The tags are described below.

| Tag name| Required| Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| WRMHEADER| Yes| Outermost element of the header object. It can contain one **DATA** element and must contain one version attribute. The version for the header is "4.3.0.0". Every time Microsoft defines new mandatory tags or attributes, a new version number is associated with those tags or attributes. If the version is greater than that for which the Client code was written, then the Client code must fail, because it implies that the header contains mandatory tags that the Client does not understand. If the version is less than or equal to that for which the Client code was written, than the Client code can safely skip any tags or attributes that it does not understand.|
| DATA| No| Container element for header data, including third-party tags. No more than one **DATA** element may be included in the **WRMHEADER** element.|
| PROTECTINFO| No| Specifies zero or one **KIDS** element. No more than one **PROTECTINFO** element may be included in the **DATA** element.|
| KIDS| No| Specifies one or more **KID** elements that may be used for creating decryptor objects for the associated content. Either one or zero **KIDS** elements may exist under the **PROTECTINFO** node.|
| KID| No| Contains all key data for a given license. If the **KIDS** node is present, one or more **KID** element must exist under the **KIDS** node. The **KID** element contains the following attributes.<br/><br/>**ALGID**: Optional. Specifies the encryption algorithm. May be set to either: "AESCTR", "AESCBC", or "COCKTAIL".<br/><br/>**CHECKSUM**: Optional. Only for AESCTR keys. Contains a checksum calculated by using the KID VALUE attribute and content key. Refer to the [Key Checksum Algorithm](#keychecksum) section of this document for details.<br/><br/>If this node exists in the WRMHeader XML then its data value must be empty.<br/><br/>**VALUE**: Required. Contains a base64-encoded key ID GUID value. Note that this GUID (DWORD, WORD, WORD, 8-BYTE array) value must be little endian byte order.|
| LA_URL| No| Contains the URL for the license acquisition Web service. Only absolute URLs are allowed. No more than one **LA_URL** element may be included in the **DATA** element.<br/><br/>If this node exists in the WRMHeader XML then its data value must not be empty.|
| LUI_URL| No| Contains the URL for a non-silent license acquisition Web page. Only absolute URLs are allowed. No more than one **LUI_URL** element may be included in the **DATA** element.<br/><br/>If this node exists in the WRMHeader XML then its data value must not be empty.|
| DS_ID| No| Service ID for the domain service. Only up to one **DS_ID** element may be included in the **DATA** element.<br/><br/>If this node exists in the WRMHeader XML then its data value must not be empty.|
| CUSTOMATTRIBUTES| No| The content author can add custom XML inside this element. Microsoft code does not act on any data contained inside this element. No more than one **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** element may be included in the **DATA** element.<br/><br/>If this node exists in the WRMHeader XML then its data value must not be empty.|
| DECRYPTORSETUP| No| This tag may only contain the value "ONDEMAND". When this tag is present in the **DATA** node and its value is set to "ONDEMAND" then it indicates to an application that it should not expect the full license chain for the content to be available for acquisition, or already present on the Client machine, prior to setting up the media graph. If this tag is not set then it indicates that an application can enforce the license to be acquired, or already present on the Client machine, prior to setting up the media graph. No more than one **DECRYPTORSETUP** element may be included in the **DATA** element.

### 3.4. v4.2.0.0

PlayReady Header v4.2.0.0 was introduced with PlayReady version 3.0 in April 2015 to allow multiple KIDs in a single header. This means that multiple keys can be used to encrypt a single asset, for example when the audio tracks must be encrypted with a different key than the video tracks.

#### 3.4.1. Differences with other versions

PlayReady 3.0 SDKs and later Clients are able to process both the v4.0, v4.1, and v4.2 PlayReady Header versions. Prior PlayReady SDKs return an “unsupported version” error when provided with v4.2 headers. When using the v4.2 header, the Client has to know what Server version it is using through a custom, app-specific mechanism. PlayReady SDKs provide no native way to get this version information.

The PlayReady Header format v.4.2.0.0 has the following changes compared to v4.1.0.0:

  *  The **WRMHEADER** element’s version attribute is set to the string “4.2.0.0”.
  *  The **KID** element located inside the **PROTECTINFO** element has been renamed to **KIDS** and is still optional.
  *  Multiple **KID** elements are located inside the **KIDS** element.

#### 3.4.2. Example

PlayReady Header 4.2.0.0 with two AESCTR keys:

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.2.0.0">
  <DATA>
    <PROTECTINFO>
      <KIDS>
        <KID ALGID="AESCTR" CHECKSUM="xNvWVxoWk04=" VALUE="0IbHou/5s0yzM80yOkKEpQ=="></KID>
        <KID ALGID="AESCTR" CHECKSUM="GnKaQIRacPU=" VALUE="/qgG2xbs4k2SKCxx6bhWqw=="></KID>
      </KIDS>
    </PROTECTINFO>
    <LA_URL>http://rm.contoso.com/rightsmanager.asmx</LA_URL>
    <DS_ID>AH+03juKbUGbHl1V/QIwRA==</DS_ID>
  </DATA>
</WRMHEADER>
```

#### 3.4.3. Format

The PlayReady Header v4.2.0.0 has the following syntax.

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.2.0.0">
  <DATA>
      <PROTECTINFO>
        <KIDS>
          <KID ALGID="AESCTR" CHECKSUM="base64-encoded value" VALUE="base64-encoded guid"></KID>
          <KID ALGID="AESCTR" CHECKSUM="base64-encoded value" VALUE="base64-encoded guid"></KID>
          <KID ALGID="AESCTR" CHECKSUM="base64-encoded value" VALUE="base64-encoded guid"></KID>
        </KIDS>
      </PROTECTINFO>
      <LA_URL> URL for license acquisition </LA_URL>
      <LUI_URL>
        URL for Non-silent license acquisition web page
      </LUI_URL>
    <DS_ID> base64-encoded guid </DS_ID>
    <CUSTOMATTRIBUTES xmlns="">
      <mm:Publisher xmlns:mm="urn:schema-musicmogul-com">
           <mm:Author>

### 3.5. v4.1.0.0

PlayReady Header v4.1.0.0 was introduced with PlayReady version 2.0 in September 2011 to support live linear streams with scalable leaf licenses embedded in the stream. This type of stream requires Clients to bind a scalable root license without knowledge of the content encryption key that will be used in the decryptor.

#### 3.5.1. Differences with other versions

PlayReady 2.0 SDKs and later Clients are able to process both the v4.0 and v4.1 PlayReady Header versions. Prior PlayReady SDKs return an “unsupported version” error when provided with v4.1 headers.

The PlayReady Header format v.4.1.0.0 has the following changes compared to v4.0.0.0:

  *  The **WRMHEADER** element’s version attribute is set to the string “4.1.0.0”.
  *  The **DATA** element contains an optional **DECRYPTORSETUP** element.
  *  The **KID** element is located inside the **PROTECTINFO** element and is optional rather than required.
  *  The **KID** element contains the attributes **ALGID** (required), **CHECKSUM** (optional), and **VALUE** (required).
  *  The **KEYLEN** element has been removed. The **KEYLEN** attribute was previously used to disambiguate cocktail licenses with different length keys. The v4.1 header will break the ability to support anything but 8-byte cocktail keys. If you use cocktail keys that aren't 8-byte, you must use v4.0 headers.
  *  The **ALGID** and **CHECKSUM** elements have been removed since their data is contained within attributes of the **KID** element.

#### 3.5.2. Format

The PlayReady Header v4.1.0.0 has the following syntax.

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.1.0.0">
  <DATA>
      <PROTECTINFO>
        <KID ALGID="AESCTR" CHECKSUM=“base64-encoded value” VALUE="base64-encoded guid"></KID>

If this tag is not set then it indicates that an application can enforce the license to be acquired, or already present on the Client machine, prior to setting up the media graph. Only up to one **DECRYPTORSETUP** element may be included in the **DATA** element.|

Notes for v4.1:

  *  All XML tags and attributes in the PlayReady Header are defined by Microsoft. The only exception is the content of the **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** element. PlayReady PC application developers must not add any custom tags outside of the **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** element.
  *  The PlayReady Header should abide by the W3C Canonical XML v1.1 specifications ([http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n11/](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n11/)).
  *  The PlayReady Header does not contain a top-level `?XML` tag that is required in well-formed XML.
  *  It is recommended that the size of this field should not exceed 1 KB.

### 3.6. v4.0.0.0

PlayReady Header v4.0.0.0 was introduced with PlayReady version 1.0 in 2008 and allows a single AESCTR key to support AES encrypted content, or a COCKTAIL key to support WMDRM encrypted content.

#### 3.6.2. Format

The PlayReady Header v4.0.0.0 has the following syntax.

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.0.0.0">
<DATA>
      <PROTECTINFO>
        <ALGID>AESCTR</ALGID>
        <KEYLEN>16</KEYLEN>
      </PROTECTINFO>
      <LA_URL> URL for license acquisition </LA_URL>
      <LUI_URL>
        URL for Non-silent license acquisition web page
      </LUI_URL>
    <DS_ID>base64-encoded guid</DS_ID>
    <KID>base64-encoded kid</KID>
    <CUSTOMATTRIBUTES xmlns="">
      <mm:Publisher xmlns:mm="urn:schema-musicmogul-com">
           <mm:Author>
                Elvis Presley
           </mm:Author>
           <mm:CreationDate>
                2007/08/21:12:00:00
           </mm:CreationDate>
        </mm:Publisher>
    </CUSTOMATTRIBUTES>
    <CHECKSUM>
      checksum of the content key for verification
    </CHECKSUM>
  </DATA>
</WRMHEADER>
```

The following table describes the different tags.

| Tag name| Required| Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| WRMHEADER| Yes| Outermost element of the header object. It can contain one **DATA** element and one version attribute. The version for the header is "4.0.0.0".<br/><br/>Semantics for packager:<br/>Every time Microsoft defines new mandatory tags or attributes, a new version number is associated with those tags or attributes. The version of the PlayReady Header must be set to the highest of the versions of the mandatory tags and attributes present in the header.<br/><br/>Semantics for Client:<br/>If the version is greater than that for which the Client code was written, then the Client code must fail because it implies that the header contains mandatory tags that the Client does not understand. If the version is less than or equal to that for which the Client code was written, then the Client code can safely skip any tags or attributes it does not understand.|
| DATA| Yes| Container element for header data, including third-party tags.|
| PROTECTINFO| Yes| Specifies the type of encryption using the **KEYLEN** and **ALGID** child elements.|
| KEYLEN| Yes| Specifies the size of the content key. Must be set to 16 if **ALGID** is set to "AESCTR" and 7 if **ALGID** is set to "COCKTAIL".|
| ALGID| Yes| Specifies the encryption algorithm. Must be set to the following value:<br/><br/>AESCTR: Corresponds to the AES algorithm in counter mode.<br/><br/>COCKTAIL: Corresponds to the Cocktail algorithm.|
| KID| Yes| Contains a base64-encoded key ID GUID value. Note that this GUID (DWORD, WORD, WORD, 8-BYTE array) value must be little endian byte order.|
| CHECKSUM| No| Contains checksum calculated by using the KID VALUE and content key. See the [Key Checksum Algorithm](#keychecksum) section for details.<br/><br/>Previous versions of PlayReady treated this field as required, so it should be included in any header that is going to be consumed by a previous version of PlayReady.|
| LA_URL| No| Contains the URL for the license acquisition Web service. Only absolute URLs are allowed.|
| LUI_URL| No| Contains the URL for a non-silent license acquisition Web page. Only absolute URLs are allowed.|
| DS_ID| No| Service ID for the domain service.|
| CUSTOMATTRIBUTES| No| The content author can add arbitrary XML inside this element. Microsoft code does not act on any data contained inside this element.|

Notes for v4.0:

  *  All XML tags and attributes in the PlayReady Header are defined by Microsoft. The only exception is the content of the **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** element. PlayReady PC application developers must not add any custom tags outside of the **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** element as doing so may clash with future tags that Microsoft defines.
  *  The order of child elements within a container element does not matter.
  *  Note that the PlayReady Header does not contain a top-level `?XML` tag that is required in well-formed XML.
  *  It is recommended that the size of this field should not exceed 1 KB.
  *  **CHECKSUM** is required by PlayReady Server SDK up to version 1.2.
Since version 1.5, PlayReady Server SDK treats the **CHECKSUM** as optional.
PlayReady Porting Kit 1.2 out of the box requires the **CHECKSUM**.
PlayReady Porting Kit 2.0 treats the **CHECKSUM** as optional.
 
## 4. Embedded License Store (ELS)

It is good practice to add an empty Embedded License Store to the PlayReady Object under the following conditions:

  *  The PlayReady Object is to be inserted into a content file.
  * The content may be used in a context of PlayReady domains with embedded licenses.

This allows a PlayReady Client to further embed a domain-bound license in the PlayReady Object by simply populating the existing Embedded License Store and saves the effort of having to re-header the entire file with a new PlayReady Object of a larger size than that of the initial one.

>[!NOTE]
>It is recommended that you do not include an empty Embedded License Store in a PlayReady Object, aimed at being inserted as a base-64 string in a Smooth Streaming Client Manifest.

>[!NOTE]
>The recommended size is 10KB.

## 5. Key Checksum Algorithm

The checksum algorithm in the PlayReady Header is intended to protect against mismatched keys. In the early days of DRM, songs were encrypted with incorrectly labeled keys. This resulted in white noise being played back when the songs were decrypted. And if the songs were played back loud enough, the playback equipment was destroyed. With the checksum, the content key can be verified as the key that was used to encrypt the file. The algorithm works as follows:

For an **ALGID** value set to “AESCBC”, there is no Key Checksum Algorithm defined. The **CHECKSUM** attribute must be omitted.

For an **ALGID** value set to “AESCTR”, the 16-byte Key ID is encrypted with a 16-byte AES content key using ECB mode. The first 8 bytes of the buffer is extracted and base64 encoded.

For an **ALGID** value set to “COCKTAIL”, perform the following steps:

1.	A 21-byte buffer is created.
2.	The content key is put in the buffer and the rest of the buffer is filled with zeros.
3.	For five iterations:

    a.	buffer = SHA-1 (buffer).

4.	The first 7 bytes of the buffer are extracted and base64 encoded.
5.	After these steps are performed, the base64-encoded bytes are used as the checksum.

## 6. CUSTOMATTRIBUTES

A service provider can add proprietary XML inside the **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** element of the PlayReady Header. Any tags used inside the **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** element are guaranteed to not clash with future tags defined by Microsoft.

Microsoft code does not act on any XML inside this element. The service provider’s backend or their Client side code are the only ones who typically interpret the value of this element. For example, let’s say a white label service represents front-end services AAA, BBB, CCC. Such a service can encrypt its content library only once (since that is an expensive operation), but when it serves out content to an end-user, it can set the **CUSTOMATTRIBUTES** to the name of the specific front-end service that the end-user subscribes to. When the end user requests a license for that content, this enables the white label service to determine which front-end service the end-user subscribes to, so that it can issue a different license.

It is recommended that the size of this field should not exceed 1 kilobyte (KB).

## 7. Content Key Seed Algorithm

Services implementing PlayReady must maintain a Key Management System (KMS) to store and manage content keys. Specifically, the values of {KID, Content Key} is stored for each content asset that is managed by the service. These values are stored at encryption time, and retrieved at license issuance time.

PlayReady provides a convenient way to avoid a complex KMS. The Content Key Seed algorithm allows derivation of different content keys for a collection of content assets, from a varying KID and a fixed Key Seed:

  `Ck(KID) = f(KID, KeySeed)`

The following is the PlayReady standard algorithm:

```cpp
byte[] GeneratePlayReadyContentKey(byte[] keySeed, Guid keyId)
{
    const int DRM_AES_KEYSIZE_128 = 16;
    byte[] contentKey = new byte[DRM_AES_KEYSIZE_128];
    //
    //  Truncate the key seed to 30 bytes, key seed must be at least 30 bytes long.
    //
    byte[] truncatedKeySeed = new byte[30];
    Array.Copy(keySeed, truncatedKeySeed, truncatedKeySeed.Length);
    //
    //  Get the keyId as a byte array
    //
    byte[] keyIdAsBytes = keyId.ToByteArray();
    //
    //  Create sha_A_Output buffer.  It is the SHA of the truncatedKeySeed and the keyIdAsBytes
    //
    SHA256Managed sha_A = new SHA256Managed();
    sha_A.TransformBlock(truncatedKeySeed, 0, truncatedKeySeed.Length, truncatedKeySeed, 0);
    sha_A.TransformFinalBlock(keyIdAsBytes, 0, keyIdAsBytes.Length);
    byte[] sha_A_Output = sha_A.Hash;
    //
    //  Create sha_B_Output buffer.  It is the SHA of the truncatedKeySeed, the keyIdAsBytes, and
    //  the truncatedKeySeed again.
    //
    SHA256Managed sha_B = new SHA256Managed();
    sha_B.TransformBlock(truncatedKeySeed, 0, truncatedKeySeed.Length, truncatedKeySeed, 0);
    sha_B.TransformBlock(keyIdAsBytes, 0, keyIdAsBytes.Length, keyIdAsBytes, 0);
    sha_B.TransformFinalBlock(truncatedKeySeed, 0, truncatedKeySeed.Length);
    byte[] sha_B_Output = sha_B.Hash;
    //
    //  Create sha_C_Output buffer.  It is the SHA of the truncatedKeySeed, the keyIdAsBytes,
    //  the truncatedKeySeed again, and the keyIdAsBytes again.
    //
    SHA256Managed sha_C = new SHA256Managed();
    sha_C.TransformBlock(truncatedKeySeed, 0, truncatedKeySeed.Length, truncatedKeySeed, 0);
    sha_C.TransformBlock(keyIdAsBytes, 0, keyIdAsBytes.Length, keyIdAsBytes, 0);
    sha_C.TransformBlock(truncatedKeySeed, 0, truncatedKeySeed.Length, truncatedKeySeed, 0);
    sha_C.TransformFinalBlock(keyIdAsBytes, 0, keyIdAsBytes.Length);
    byte[] sha_C_Output = sha_C.Hash;
    for (int i = 0; i < DRM_AES_KEYSIZE_128; i++)
    {
        contentKey[i] = Convert.ToByte(sha_A_Output[i] ^ sha_A_Output[i + DRM_AES_KEYSIZE_128]
                                       ^ sha_B_Output[i] ^ sha_B_Output[i + DRM_AES_KEYSIZE_128]
                                       ^ sha_C_Output[i] ^ sha_C_Output[i + DRM_AES_KEYSIZE_128]);
    }

    return contentKey;
}
```
