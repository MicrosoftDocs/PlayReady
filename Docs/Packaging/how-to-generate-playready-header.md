# How to generate a PlayReady Header

The packager needs to include a PlayReady Header in the encrypted content.

For a detailed description of the PlayReady Header and the PlayReady Object, see the [PlayReady Header Specification](../Specifications/playready-header-specification.md).

The PlayReady Header contains information about the content being played back, including the key identifiers (KIDs) that identify the keys used to encrypt the data, the default license acquisition URL of the PlayReady License Server, and any custom data that you want to include. The key and KID used to encrypt the content must be shared with the PlayReady License Server that will be issuing the licenses for that specific content, typically through a Key Management System (KMS).

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft does not provide a Key Management System with PlayReady.

Here is an example of a PlayReady Header, which may be inserted in the header of a fragmented MP4 file, typically for On-Demand content:

```xml
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.3.0.0">
  <DATA>
    <PROTECTINFO>
      <KIDS>
        <KID ALGID="AESCTR" VALUE="PV1LM/VEVk+kEOB8qqcWDg=="></KID>
        <KID ALGID="AESCTR" VALUE="tuhDoKUN7EyxDPtMRNmhyA=="></KID>
      </KIDS>
    </PROTECTINFO>
    <LA_URL>http://rm.contoso.com/rightsmanager.asmx</LA_URL>
    <DS_ID>AH+03juKbUGbHl1V/QIwRA==</DS_ID>
  </DATA>
</WRMHEADER>
```

Here is an example of a PlayReady Header, for Live Linear content:

```xml
To do
<WRMHEADER xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader" version="4.3.0.0">
</WRMHEADER>
```

There are multiple ways to create a PlayReady Header generator in your packager. The following sections describe, in general, how you can generate a PlayReady Header. 

## Method 1 - Build your own code based on the PlayReady Header Specification

Before you can create the PlayReady Header: 

  * You will need to have the KeyID(s) that were generated by the key management system.
  * You will need to know the encryption type (AESCTR or AESCBC).
  * You will need to know the URL of the PlayReady license server that will be issuing licenses.
  * If you are using domains, you will need to know the domain service identifier.

You can now create the PlayReady header using standard XML commands (such as XMLWriter, XMLDocument, or XDocument). The following sample demonstrates how to create a PlayReady Header used for On-Demand content. 

``` cs
public string buildRMHeader(string KeyID1, string KeyID2, string encryptMode, string domainID)
{
    // The string parameters are values returned from the key management system and include the following:
    // KeyID1, KeyID2 - The key identifiers
    // encryptMode - the encryption mode used to encrypt content, can be AESCTR or AESCBC
    // domainID - the optional domain service identifier (only used for domains)

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    XmlWriterSettings xws = new XmlWriterSettings();
    xws.OmitXmlDeclaration = true;

    using (XmlWriter xw = XmlWriter.Create(sb, xws))
    {
        XElement root = new XElement("WRMHEADER",
            new XAttribute("xmlns", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/DRM/2007/03/PlayReadyHeader"),
            new XAttribute("version", "4.3.0.0"),
            new XElement("DATA",
                new XElement("PROTECTINFO",
                    new XElement("KIDS",
                        new XElement("KID",
                            new XAttribute("ALGID", encryptMode),
                            new XAttribute("VALUE", KeyID1)
                        ),
                        new XElement("KID",
                            new XAttribute("ALGID", encryptMode),
                            new XAttribute("VALUE", KeyID2)
                        )
                    )
                ),
                new XElement("LA_URL", "http://rm.contoso.com/rightsmanager.asmx"),
                new XElement("DS_ID", domainID)
            )
        );
        root.Save(xw);
    }
    return(sb.ToString());
}
```

## Method 2 - Use the PlayReady Server API

If you are a PlayReady Server SDK licensee, the server SDK contains the **PlayReadyHeader** class that can be used to construct a PlayReady Header. It includes methods you can use and properties you can fill in with the information required for a PlayReady Header. 

The **PlayReadyHeader** class is described in detail in the PlayReady documentation you receive with your PlayReady Server SDK license. The PlayReady Server SDK also includes a sample packager (AESPackaging) that demonstrates how to create a PlayReady Header.

As in Method 1, you will need the KeyID(s) that were generated by the key management system, the encryption type (AESCTR or AESCBC), the URL of the PlayReady license server,and optionally, the domain service identifier.  

## Method 3 - Use a Windows application

Things you need before you begin.
  1. You have to have the KeyID(s) that were generated by the key management system.
  2. You have to know the encryption type (AESCTR or AESCBC).
  3. Create the PlayReady header inside the PlayReady object using the Windows 10 PlayReadyHeaderContentHeader class.

As in the previous methods, you will need the KeyID(s) that were generated by the key management system, the encryption type (AESCTR or AESCBC), the URL of the PlayReady license server,and optionally, the domain service identifier.
