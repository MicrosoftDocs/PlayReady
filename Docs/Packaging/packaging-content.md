# Packaging Content

PlayReady helps secure encrypted content by distributing and controlling the use of content encryption keys over networks and in clients. With this technology, content owners and services distributing high-valued content can monetize their content with full control over their business model.

Companies developing a packager or encoder (also known as encryptor) utilizing PlayReady technologies need to integrate two functionalities in their product:

* One that encrypts content in a PlayReady compatible encryption format.

* Another that generates a PlayReady Header and inserts it in the encrypted content.
