## Best practices for authoring

Across Microsoft we are using the concept of "Voice" to create content that is friendly, helpful, straightforward, and easy to find and use. We find our voice by understanding and applying voice principles when we create content, whether the format is text, video, or diagrams.

Windows applies these voice principles to documentation for our customers:

-   Focus on the customer intent
-   Use everyday language
-   Write concisely
-   Make it easy to scan
-   Show empathy

They embody the [voice and tone of One Microsoft](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28361).

## Authoring for good accessibility

When authoring, please keep in mind [good accessibility practices](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/style/style-how-to-accessibility?branch=master), such as including [Alt Text](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/style/style-how-to-alt-text), using neutral "[Input Method](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/style/style-how-to-input-methods)" language, such as "Select" or "Choose", rather than "Click" or "Tap".
