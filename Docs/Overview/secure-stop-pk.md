# PlayReady Secure Stop


Introduced in PlayReady version 3.0, *PlayReady Secure Stop* is a feature that provides the means for a PlayReady device to confidently assert to a media streaming service that media playback has stopped for any given piece of content. This capability ensures your media streaming services provide accurate enforcement and reporting of usage limitations on different devices for a given account.

## Secure Stop overview

A Secure Stop event is reported to a Secure Stop Server by the client when media playback stops, either at the end of the media or because the user stopped the media presentation somewhere in the middle. When a Secure Stop event is reported, and at the time the Secure Stop event is recorded, the PlayReady Client ensures that the content key is erased from memory. A Secure Stop is also reported when the previous session ends unexpectedly (for example, due to a system or application crash).

> [!NOTE]
> Secure Stop applies only to non-persistent licenses.

There are two primary scenarios for sending a Secure Stop challenge:

   *  When the media playback stops either at the end, or because the user stopped the media presentation somewhere in the middle.
   *  When the previous session ends unexpectedly (for example, due to a system or app crash). The app will need to query, either at startup or shutdown, for any outstanding Secure Stop sessions and send challenge(s) separate from any other media playback.

For information about Secure Stop in UWP apps, see the *[Add secure stop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/playready-Client-sdk#add-secure-stop)* section in the [PlayReady DRM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/playready-client-sdk) article.

## Secure Stop 2

In PlayReady version 4.2, *PlayReady Secure Stop 2* provides more security by enforcing the Secure Stop functionality on the client in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) at Security Level 3000.

A service may use the SecureStop feature to enforce playback across multiple clients belonging to a same user account. Depending on the configuration of a particular client in that user account, the service will receive slightly different messages form the client.

The following table shows the Server App logic on different Client Security Level and Secure Stop versions.

    <td>Server receives a SecureStop2 message from the client.
