# PlayReady Secure Delete Server

Introduced in PlayReady version 4.0, *PlayReady Secure Delete* is a feature that allows service providers to receive secure acknowledgement when a persistent license is deleted by the application on the client. Previously, when a license was deleted, service providers were not notified when deletion was completed. With PlayReady Secure Delete, the following operations are possible.

* Service providers can track which licenses are currently stored and which licenses have been deleted, on a given client machine.
* Service providers can issue a specific number of persistent licenses to a client, and track the count of licenses on that clientâ€™s machine.
* The Secure Delete feature also satisfies the [Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/) requirement as defined in September 2017, which specifies that a record of license deletion must be sent to the Server upon license deletion.
