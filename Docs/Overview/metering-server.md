# PlayReady Metering Server

*PlayReady Metering* is a feature that allows services to receive usage information from PlayReady clients. For example, how many times a certain piece of content was played. This information is secured by PlayReady, and can be trusted by the service. For example, it can be used to pay royalties to the content owner if the content distribution deal is based on user consumption.

A *PlayReady Metering Server*, also known as a *PlayReady Metering Aggregation Service*, is a server that receives PlayReady transactions from PlayReady clients that contain the metering information. It parses the information received, uses it for the purpose defined by the service (for example, stores the information in a database, counts totals), and sends acknowledgement to clients so they can delete this usage information from their memory.

It is a logical server based on the *PlayReady Server SDK* like all the PlayReady Server types, and can be operated on the same machine as the other PlayReady servers, or on a different machine.
