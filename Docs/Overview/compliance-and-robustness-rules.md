# PlayReady Compliance and Robustness Rules (CR&RRs)

Microsoft edits and publishes the PlayReady Compliance Rules and the PlayReady Robustness Rules, the requirements of which all PlayReady Final Products distributed on the market must satisfy, as specified in the PlayReady license agreement(s) customers sign with Microsoft.

   * The definition of the right modifiers that a PlayReady license can contain (expiration, output limitation, and so on).
   * Requirements on companies operating a PlayReady License Server (update Revocation Lists frequently).
   * Requirements on companies distributing devices embedding a PlayReady Client stack (how these devices are allowed to manipulate PlayReady keys and decrypted content).


## PlayReady Robustness Rules
