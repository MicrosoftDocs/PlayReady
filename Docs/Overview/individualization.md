# PlayReady Individualization


Individualization is the process of updating the PlayReady runtime on the client computer, allowing licenses to be bound to the client computer.


Individualization must be performed on a personal computer before most DRM-related operations will be allowed.


When a computer is individualized, the PlayReady runtime is tied to the computer and will not be able to decode licenses on or from any other computer (outside of its domain).
