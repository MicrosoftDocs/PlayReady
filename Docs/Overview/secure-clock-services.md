# PlayReady Secure Clock Services for PlayReady Clients

Microsoft operates a service to which a PlayReady client can connect to acquire the current time and set their trusted clocks. Their trusted clock is used to enforce PlayReady time-based policies, such as content rental expiration.

Microsoft runs multiple versions of these services depending on the version and security level of the client requesting the time.
