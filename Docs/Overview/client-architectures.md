# PlayReady Client Architectures
This topic provides an overview of the different PlayReady Client architectures that are available. A PlayReady client can be either a device or an application that receives content for playback. The PlayReady Device Porting Kit is intended for original equipment manufactures (OEMs) who are developing devices (such as physical hardware or operating systems), and for application developers who are integrating their applications in a device.

The following figure shows the client implementation options available using PlayReady.

A device that embeds a DRM client (by using the Content Decryption Module (CDM)), exposes an API to applications that have different forms. Some of these forms are:

   *  On Windows 10 UWP, the **Windows.Media.Protection.PlayReady** namespace is available in C#, JavaScript, and C++. See [Windows.​Media.​Protection.​Play​Ready Namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Protection.PlayReady) for more information.

      *  For more information on using PlayReady for Windows 10, see [PlayReady DRM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/playready-client-sdk).

      *  For more information on using PlayReady for Windows 8, see [Developing PlayReady Windows 8.1 Store and Web Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn468834.aspx).

   *  On HTML5, the [Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)](http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/).

   *  On Android, the [**DrmManagerClient** class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/drm/DrmManagerClient.html). See the [PlayReady DRM Plugin for Android Microsoft Specification](../Specifications/playready-drm-plugin-for-android-specification.md) for more information.

There is another possible deployment model &mdash; developing the porting kit in the application. How you do this is entirely up to you (that is, whether you develop it yourself, or use an SDK supplied by a [PlayReady Partner](https://www.microsoft.com/playready/partners/)), and will not be discussed in this document.

The following table shows the current availability and percentage of units that ship PlayReady in non-Windows clients.
