# PlayReady Clients
This topic provides a description of the different ways to implement a PlayReady client in a device or in an application. Regarding application development, there may be two cases depending on whether the device embeds a PlayReady client (like Windows 10) or whether the device does not embed a PlayReady in the OS or in the chip (like iOS).
