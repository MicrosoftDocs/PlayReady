# About PlayReady Technologies


The following topics describe the fundamental technologies that enable the scenarios described in [Common PlayReady Scenarios](commonplayreadyscenarios.md).

| Topic| Description|
| --- | --- |
| [PlayReady Communication Protocols](playreadycommunicationprotocols.md)| Describes how a PlayReady client and a PlayReady server communicate with each other.|
| [PlayReady Content Encryption Overview](playreadycontentencryptionoverview.md)| Describes the encryption mechanisms and file format concepts used to protect content in the PlayReady ecosystem. |
| [PlayReady Content Encryption Modes](playreadycontentencryptionmodes.md)| Describes the encryption modes that PlayReady supports. |
| [Licenses Overview](licensesoverview.md) | Licenses store the information necessary to access the associated content and store the rules by which that content can be accessed. |
| [Trusted Clocks](trustedclocks.md)| Describes how to use trusted clocks in time-based scenarios.|
| [PlayReady Metering](playreadymetering.md)| Describes the process for metering content.|
| [PlayReady Domains](playreadydomains.md)| Describes PlayReady domains, domain management, and how target clients can bind to specific domains. |
| [PlayReady Secure Delete](playreadysecuredelete.md)| Describes how service providers can receive secure acknowledgement when a persistent license is deleted by the client. |
| [PlayReady Secure Stop](playreadysecurestop.md)| Describes how service providers can receive secure acknowledgement when media playback has stopped for any given piece of content.
| [Individualization](individualization.md)| Describes the process of updating the PlayReady runtime on the client computer, allowing licenses to be bound to the client computer. |
| [Revocation](revocation.md)| Describes the process that identifies clients with compromised security and prevents them from getting access to additional licenses. |
| [PlayReady Interoperability With Other Protection Technologies](playreadyinteroperabilitywithotherprotectiontechnologies.md)| Describes how PlayReady ecosystems are able to interoperate with other content protection systems. |
