# PlayReady on Windows

## PlayReady on Windows 10, 8.1

For Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications, Microsoft provides a PlayReady SDK integrated in the Windows SDK. For more information about PlayReady on UWP applications, see the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/playready-client-sdk).

For Windows Store applications (Windows 8.1), Microsoft also provides a PlayReady SDK. For the Windows 8.1 reference, see [Developing PlayReady Windows Store and Web Apps](/previous-versions/windows/apps/dn468834(v=ieb.10)).

## PlayReady on Windows 7, MacOS

Some Microsoft Partners provide SDKs to run PlayReady on Windows 7 and Mac OS, based on Electron, Xamarin, or other technologies. You can contact these [PlayReady Partners](https://www.microsoft.com/playready/partners/) directly for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> The PlayReady Desktop PC SDK, designed for Desktop PC applications and previously used for Windows 7 applications, is deprecated and should not be used.
