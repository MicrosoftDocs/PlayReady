# PlayReady Test Server

The PlayReady Test Server website includes documentation and test tools for PlayReady developers to test your products. Whether you are a PlayReady licensee or a non-licensee, an OEM, SOC vendor, a client developer, and application developer, an encoder vendor, or a service developer, this website provides you with the following tools:

   *  A test license service
   *  Test video content (video and audio tracks)
   *  Test audio content
   *  Test applications (HTML/JS, Silverlight)

> [!NOTE]
> Content and licenses delivered from this website are public and do not provide the level of security required for a production service.

The PlayReady Test Server is provided as an optional service to PlayReady developers. You do not need to use this service to test or certify your PlayReady implementations. For more information, see the [PlayReady Test Server](http://test.playready.microsoft.com/) website.
