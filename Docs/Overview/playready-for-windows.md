# PlayReady for Windows

For Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications and Windows Store applications (Windows 8.1), Microsoft provides a PlayReady PC SDK integrated in the Windows SDK. For more information about PlayReady on UWP applications, see the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt429381.aspx). For Windows 8.1 reference, see [Developing PlayReady Windows Store and Web Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn468834.aspx).

Some Microsoft Partners provide SDKs to run PlayReady on Windows 7 and Mac OS, based on Electron, Xamarin, or other technologies. You can contact these [PlayReady Partners](https://www.microsoft.com/playready/partners/) directly for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> The PlayReady Desktop PC SDK, designed for Desktop PC applications, is deprecated and should not be used.
