# PlayReady Certificates and Certificate Authority

## PlayReady Certificates

A certificate is a digitally-signed binary document used to grant and revoke privileges to devices and servers to perform specific operations. PlayReady customers can request several different types of certificates depending on their needs.

Certificates generally fall into two main categories: server certificates and client certificates. Server certificates allow a Customer to run the PlayReady Server SDK; client or device certificates allow devices to play content. There are also test client certificates, which are only used for test devices and can be revoked at any time.


## PlayReady Certificate Authority

Microsoft owns the PlayReady Certificate Authority (PlayReady CA) including the PlayReady top level CA certificates, which gives Microsoft the authority to deliver PlayReady certificates to its customers, and revoke them whenever it is required to keep the ecosystem functional and secure.

Complete information about certificates and how to obtain different types of certificates is contained in the PlayReady Documentation Help file that is supplied to PlayReady licensees.
